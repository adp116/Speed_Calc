This project is a web application that allows users to calculate the speed of a baseball throw. By entering the distance from the mound to the plate and timing the throw in real-time, the application accurately calculates the speed using 2D kinematics, accounting for factors such as air resistance. The speed is displayed in miles per hour.

Features
Real-time timing: Users can start and stop the timer as the baseball is thrown and crosses the plate.
Distance input: The user can input the distance between the mound and the plate, which is then converted from feet to meters.
Speed calculation: The application uses 2D kinematics and accounts for air resistance to calculate the speed of the throw, adjusting for estimated user lag.
Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: N/A (Client-side application)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/baseball-speed-calculator.git
cd baseball-speed-calculator
Open the application: Simply open the index.html file in your web browser to use the application.

Usage
Enter distance: Input the distance from the pitcher's mound to the plate in feet.
Start timer: Click the "Start" button as the pitcher releases the ball.
Stop timer: Click the "Stop" button when the ball crosses the plate.
Reset: Use the "Reset" button to clear the timer and result for a new measurement.
How It Works
JavaScript Functionality
Timer initialization: The timer starts at zero and counts in tenths of a second. When the user clicks "Start," the timer begins counting. Clicking "Stop" halts the timer and triggers the speed calculation.
Distance conversion: The entered distance in feet is converted to meters for accurate calculations using the formula 
1
 foot
=
0.3048
 meters
1 foot=0.3048 meters.
Kinematic calculation: The speed is calculated using the 2D kinematics formula, accounting for air resistance and adjusting for a user lag of 0.2 seconds. The final speed is then converted to miles per hour.
Displaying results: The calculated speed is displayed in real-time on the web page.
User Interface (UI)
HTML structure: The HTML file provides the structure of the web page, including input fields, buttons, and areas for displaying results.
CSS styling: The CSS file ensures the UI is responsive and visually appealing, with a focus on usability.
JavaScript interactions: JavaScript handles all user interactions, from starting and stopping the timer to calculating and displaying the results.
